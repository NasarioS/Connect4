Connect Four in JavaFX

If you pull the project and then and run Board.java on your machine, you can test the Java applcation, you will need a java compiler, with jre and JavaFX installed. 
Alteraltively, you can donwload the jar file from my website at http://nasarios.com/portfolio.html, note to run the jar file you will still need Java and Javafx Installed on your machine, also this project was made with Eclipse on Windows 10.
